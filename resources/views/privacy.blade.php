        <h2 class="text-xl text-orange-700 my-4 font-semibold mb-2">Retention of Your Personal Data</h2>
        <p class="my-2">The Company will retain Your Personal Data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes
            set out in this
            Privacy Policy. We will retain and use Your Personal Data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal
            obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve
            disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.</p>

        <p class="my-2">The Company will also retain Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is generally
            retained for a
            shorter period of time, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the
            functionality
            of Our Service, or We are legally obligated to retain this data for longer time periods.</p>

        <h2 class="text-xl text-orange-700 my-4 font-semibold mb-2">Transfer of Your Personal Data</h2>
        <p class="my-2">Your information, including Personal Data, is processed at the Company's operating offices and
            in any other
            places where the parties involved in the processing are located. It means that this information may be
            transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of Your state, province, country or other
            governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those from Your jurisdiction.</p>

        <p class="my-2">Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by Your submission of such information represents
            Your agreement to
            that transfer.</p>

        <p class="my-2">The Company will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that Your data is treated
            securely and in
            accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of Your Personal Data will take place to an organization
            or
            a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of Your data and other personal
            information.</p>

        <h2 class="text-xl text-orange-700 my-4 font-semibold mb-2"> Delete Your Personal Data</h2>
        <p class="my-2">You have the right to delete or request that We assist in deleting the Personal Data that We
            have collected
            about You.</p>

        <p class="my-2">Our Service may give You the ability to delete certain information about You from within the
            Service.</p>

        <p class="my-2">You may update, amend, or delete Your information at any time by signing in to Your Account, if
            you have one,
            and visiting the account settings section that allows you to manage Your personal information. You may also
            contact Us to request access to, correct, or delete any personal information that You have provided to
            Us.</p>

        <p class="my-2">Please note, however, that We may need to retain certain information when we have a legal
            obligation or lawful
            basis to do so.</p>

        <h2 class="text-xl text-orange-700 my-4 font-semibold my-4">Disclosure of Your Personal Data</h2>
        <h3 class="text-orange-700 my-2 text-lg font-medium">Business Transactions</h3>
        <p class="my-2">If the Company is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, Your Personal Data may be
            transferred. We
            will provide notice before Your Personal Data is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy
            Policy.</p>

        <h3 class="text-orange-700 my-2 text-lg font-medium">Law enforcement</h3>
        <p class="my-2">Under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to disclose Your Personal Data if
            required to do so by
            law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g. a court or a government agency).</p>

        <h3 class="text-orange-700 my-2 text-lg font-medium">Other legal requirements</h3>
        <p class="my-2">The Company may disclose Your Personal Data in the good faith belief that such action is
            necessary to:</p>

        <ul class="list-disc list-inside">Comply with a legal obligation
            <li class="py-1">Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company</li>
            <li class="py-1">Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service</li>
            <li class="py-1">Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public</li>
            <li class="py-1">Protect against legal liability</li>
        </ul></p>
        <h2 class="text-xl text-orange-700 my-4 font-semibold my-4">Security of Your Personal Data</h2>
        <p class="my-2">The security of Your Personal Data is important to Us, but remember that no method of
            transmission over the
            Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While We strive to use commercially acceptable
            means
            to protect Your Personal Data, We cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

        <h3 class="text-orange-700 my-2 text-lg font-medium">Children's Privacy</h3>
        <p class="my-2">Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally
            identifiable
            information from anyone under the age of 13. If You are a parent or guardian and You are aware that Your
            child
            has provided Us with Personal Data, please contact Us. If We become aware that We have collected Personal
            Data
            from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, We take steps to remove that
            information from Our servers.</p>

        <p class="my-2">If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your information and Your country
            requires consent
            from a parent, We may require Your parent's consent before We collect and use that information.</p>

        <h3 class="text-orange-700 my-2 text-lg font-medium">Links to Other Websites</h3>
        <p class="my-2">Our Service may contain links to other websites that are not operated by Us. If You click on a
            third party link,
            You will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise You to review the Privacy Policy of
            every
            site You visit.</p>

        <p class="my-2">We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or
            practices of any third
            party sites or services.</p>

        <h2 class="text-xl text-orange-700 my-4 font-semibold my-4">Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p class="my-2">We may update Our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify You of any changes by
            posting the new Privacy
            Policy on this page.</p>

        <p class="my-2">We will let You know via email and/or a prominent notice on Our Service, prior to the change
            becoming effective
            and update the "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <p class="my-2">You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this
            Privacy Policy are
            effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
